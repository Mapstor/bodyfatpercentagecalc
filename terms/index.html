    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <section class="content-section">
      <p><strong>Last Updated: January 2026</strong></p>
      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of bodyfatpercentagecalc.com (the "Service"), operated by Body Fat Percentage Calculator ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service. For questions about these Terms, visit our <a href="/contact/">Contact page</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By accessing, browsing, or using any part of this website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and anyone who accesses the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
      <p>The Service provides free, browser-based body composition estimation tools, including a body fat percentage calculator using the U.S. Navy circumference method, a U.S. Army body composition standards test, a Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI) calculator, and a body fat percentage reference chart. The Service also includes educational blog content, guides, and informational pages such as our <a href="/about/">About page</a>. All calculator computations run entirely in your web browser. No personal data, measurements, or results are sent to or stored on our servers. We provide these tools and content free of charge with no account registration required.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>3. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
      <p><strong>The Service is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</strong> The body fat estimates, body composition assessments, FFMI values, and category classifications generated by our calculators are for informational and educational purposes only. They are not a substitute for professional medical advice, clinical body composition analysis, or any form of healthcare. You should not rely on the results of this calculator to make decisions about your diet, exercise program, medical treatment, or any aspect of your health without consulting a qualified healthcare provider. If you have concerns about your body composition, weight, or overall health, seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health professional.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>4. Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>While our calculator implements peer-reviewed, validated formulas developed by the U.S. Navy and used by the U.S. military, all circumference-based body fat estimates have inherent limitations. The Navy method typically estimates body fat within 3-4 percentage points of laboratory methods for most individuals, but individual accuracy can vary. Results depend heavily on correct measurement technique, and may be less accurate for individuals with unusual body proportions, very high muscle mass, very low or very high body fat, adolescents, elderly individuals, or those with certain medical conditions. We make no warranties or guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any results produced by the calculator.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for providing accurate measurements when using the calculator and for interpreting the results appropriately. You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to: use the Service in any way that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair it; attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Service; use automated scripts, bots, or scrapers to access the Service in a manner that degrades performance for other users; reproduce, duplicate, or resell any part of the Service without express written permission; or misrepresent calculator results as clinical or medical assessments.</p>
