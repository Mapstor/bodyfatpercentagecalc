    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <section class="content-section">
      <p><strong>Last Updated: January 2026</strong></p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Body Fat Percentage Calculator ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our website at bodyfatpercentagecalc.com (the "Service"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices. Please read this policy carefully. If you have questions, you can reach us through our <a href="/contact/">Contact page</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>1. Scope</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all pages and tools available on bodyfatpercentagecalc.com, including the body fat percentage calculator, the Army body composition test, the FFMI calculator, the body fat chart, all blog guides, and all informational pages such as <a href="/about/">About</a>, Contact, Privacy, and Terms. By accessing or using any part of the Service, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, body measurements, or health information.</strong> All calculations performed by our body fat percentage calculator, Army body composition test, and FFMI calculator run entirely within your web browser using client-side JavaScript. When you enter your height, weight, neck circumference, waist circumference, or hip circumference, that data stays on your device. It is never sent to our servers or any third-party server. When you close or refresh the page, the data you entered is gone.</p>
      <p>We do not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or log in. There are no forms on this site that collect personal information, and we do not maintain any database of user data. We have no way to identify individual visitors or associate measurements with specific people.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>3. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
      <p>Our website may use minimal, privacy-respecting analytics to understand general traffic patterns, such as how many people visit the site, which pages are most popular, and what countries visitors come from. If analytics are used, they rely on aggregated, anonymized data and do not track individual users across the web. We do not use advertising cookies, tracking pixels, or retargeting technologies. We do not sell or share analytics data with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
      <p>Your browser may store standard technical cookies necessary for the website to function correctly (for example, remembering your preferred unit system). These cookies do not contain personal information and are not used for tracking.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Our website may use third-party services for hosting, content delivery, or analytics. These services may have access to standard server logs (such as IP addresses and browser user-agent strings) as part of normal web infrastructure. We select service providers that respect user privacy and limit data collection. We do not integrate any third-party advertising networks, social media trackers, or data brokers into our site. We do not share, sell, or rent any visitor information to third parties.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our Service is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Because our calculator does not collect any personal data from any user, there is no mechanism through which a child's data could be stored or processed. The body fat estimation formulas used by our calculator were developed and validated for adult populations, and we recommend that minors use these tools only under the guidance of a parent, guardian, or healthcare provider.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Because we do not collect or store personal data, there is no personal information for us to provide, correct, delete, or export. You have no data stored in our systems that would be subject to access requests, deletion requests, or data portability requests under any privacy regulation. If you believe we have inadvertently collected any personal information, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> immediately and we will investigate and address the concern.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to ensure the security and integrity of our website. Our site is served over HTTPS, which encrypts data in transit between your browser and our servers. Since all calculator computations happen locally in your browser, your body measurements and health data are never transmitted over the internet. This browser-only architecture is the strongest privacy protection we can offer: data that is never collected cannot be breached, leaked, or misused.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>8. International Users</h2>
      <p>Our Service is available to users worldwide. Because we do not collect or store personal data, there are no cross-border data transfers associated with your use of our calculator. The website infrastructure (hosting and content delivery) may be located in various countries, but since no personal user data is transmitted to our servers, international data transfer regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, or other regional privacy laws do not impose data handling obligations on us with respect to calculator usage. We are nonetheless committed to respecting the spirit of these laws and maintaining the highest privacy standards for all users regardless of location.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this page periodically for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy. If we make significant changes that affect how we handle user data, we will provide prominent notice on our website.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please reach out to us through our <a href="/contact/">Contact page</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:info@bodyfatpercentagecalc.com">info@bodyfatpercentagecalc.com</a>. You can also learn more about who we are and how our calculator works on our <a href="/about/">About page</a>. We are committed to addressing any privacy concerns promptly and transparently.</p>
